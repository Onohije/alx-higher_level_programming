         0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures


An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).

Closures
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. In this article, we explain what a prototype is, how prototype chains work, and how a prototype for an object can be set.
